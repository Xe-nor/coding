        "LIT was established in 1992 as a vocational training centre with only two staff and 12 students. However, it
        took shape
        as an institution only in 1997, when degree engineering programme commenced. LIT owes its existence to the
        vision of
        its founder who, with no land, limited finances (only Rs. 5000/-) and little knowledge of
        higher
        education to create an institution for the benefit of the society. From these small beginnings, LIT has
        developed into
        a leading university with a strong interdisciplinary culture and a commitment to teaching excellence."
